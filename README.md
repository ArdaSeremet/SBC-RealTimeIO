# SBC-RealTimeIO
This system provides a full home automation control system for Linux-based single board computers. This library is relatively easy to port to other boards as well. Currently, tested boards are NanoPi-NEO LTS, Rock Pi S and Orange Pi Zero LTS. Feel free to contact me for any questions.
